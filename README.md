# viaCep
Develop an application to help a user to query a ZIP code. Where, when entering a zip code, the screen will display address information as neighborhood, municipality and backyard. To do this, create an api rest with integration with the ViaCEP service and a web application. On the backend, a cache of the queries carried out by the user must be made. After a query is made on the viaCEP api, the address information should be stored in a database and in subsequent queries from the same zip code, this information must be returned without searching the viaCEP service. The frontend must have a screen with a field to inform the zip code, a button to perform the search, and after clicking on the button, the address information.
